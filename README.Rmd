A compilation of various commands and tools I've used that may be helpful. This package will not be routinely updated or maintained, but I'll add things as they come up.

## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](github.com) using the following:

``` r         
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("guziordo/guzioR")
```

## Usage

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(guzioR)
```

## Included Palettes

These are compilations of palettes provided by friends or otherwise generated for fun.

```{r echo = F, fig.height = 1.5}
plot(guzior.pal)
```

<i>Thank you to Dr. Lydia-Ann Ghuneim for providing the CPCOLS palette.</i>

### Big 10 Palettes

I don't own any of the rights to things from the Big 10. These are some palettes generated based on their brand identities. First two colors in each are the primary colors of that school.

```{r echo = F}
plot(b10.pal)
```

### Selecting Palettes

Each can be subset based on what groups are wanted. Thanks to [Michael McCarthy](https://github.com/mccarthy-m-g) for the original text description, which has been modified below.

-   For a single palette:

```{r single}
b10.pal$buckeye
```

-   For a multiple palettes:

```{r multi-palette}
b10.pal[c("buckeye","spartan")]
```
