A compilation of various commands and tools I've used that may be helpful. This package will not be routinely updated, but I'll add things as they come up.

## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](github.com) using the following:

``` r         
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("guziordo/guzioR")
```

## Usage

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(guzioR)
```

## Included Palettes

There are `r length(guzior.pal)` palettes included, built by myself or others.

```{r echo = F, fig.height = 1.5}
plot(guzior.pal)
```

<i>Thank you to [Dr. Lydia-Ann Ghuneim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lydia-ann-ghuneim/) for providing the CPCOLS palette.</i>

### Big 10 Palettes

I don't own any of the rights to things from the Big 10. These are some palettes generated based on their brand identities. First two colors in each are the primary colors of that school.

```{r echo = F}
plot(b10.pal)
```

## Selecting Palettes

Each can be subset based on what groups are wanted, either with `$<name>` for single palettes within a set or using the method below to select multiple.

```{asciicast extract-vector-1}
b10.pal[c("buckeye","spartan")]
```
